# Animations with CADisplayLink

## Description

This is a sample project demonstrating how to create smooth animations using CADisplayLink in iOS projects. 

This project uses a wrapper class to encapsulate CADisplayLink and fires a delegate function call with the delta time between the last display frame timestamp and the current display timestamp. This allows the movement of your object to update smoothly independently of the framerate.
